![pisound-config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/BlokasLabs/pisound-docs/images/pisound-config.png)

`pisound-config` allows reconfiguring the most important aspects of the system for use with Pisound, as well as setting up additional software and displaying some useful information. It is available since version 1.05 of `pisound-btn`.

To get started, simply open a terminal and run:

```bash
sudo pisound-config
```

If you get a command not found error, see [Installing The Pisound Software](software.md#installing-the-pisound-software) for instructions on how to get the latest version.
