            "text": "Audio\n\n\npisound is equipped with 192kHz 24-bit Stereo Input and Output. The legendary Burr-Brown Op-Amps, ADC and DAC chips are implemented in this little board to exhibit clean signal amplification and conversion between digital and analog realms. Though these chips themselves have a good power supply rejection ratio (PSRR), to ensure low-noise operation in the vicinity of an electrically noisy Raspberry Pi computer, any power line to the analog stuff is coupled via LDO\u2019s which filters any digital interference out. This design enables pisound to be graded as a high-fidelity audio device. For example a Hi-Fi device is expected to have the total harmonic distortion value (THD) less than 1% and the pisound has less than 0.05%. That means that you can daisy-chain 20 pisound boards and the chain would still be considered as a high-fidelity device!\n\n\nAudio Input\n\n\nThere is one unbalanced stereo input accessible via \u00bc\" (6.35mm) jack slot on pisound. One stereo channel can also be used as two unbalanced mono channels. Audio inputs are AC coupled to a gain stage built using \nOPA4134\n op-amps. Input resistance is 100kOhm for each channel. The gain can be adjusted simultaneously for both the left and the right channels from 0dB to +40dB with an on-board potentiometer. The maximum audio signal level before clipping is 5Vpp (at 0dB gain). The range of the gain adjustment can be divided into two sections. The first section occurs at rotation between 0% and 80% and it is used to precisely adjust for the high-level signals (line out, headphone amp out, etc...). The tight section at the maximum rotation of the gain pot acts as a +20dB switch for the low-level signals (guitar, microphone, etc.). When the signal clipping occurs in any channel, the red LED lights up and fades out after last clipped sample. Audio to digital conversion is carried out by \nPCM1804\n converter. An on-board clock oscillator delivers a clock signal to the ADC, which divides it according to the selected sample rate. ADC acts as the master of I2S line. pisound supports three sample rates: 48kHz, 96kHz and 192kHz. A filter at the input stage of PCM1804 ensures good anti-\naliasing\n.\n\n\n\nGain and input sensitivity versus position of \nGAIN\n pot\n\n\nAudio Output\n\n\nAudio output is DC coupled and can be accessed via the female \u00bc\" (6.35mm) stereo jack connector. Output volume level can be adjusted with on-board potentiometer. Maximum output level is 2.1Vrms when driving 1kOhm load. Digital to audio conversion is done in \nPCM5102A\n converter which has both Signal-to-Noise ratio and dynamic range of 112dB. The DAC acts as a slave on I2S line and the sampling rate is dictated by the ADC. An intelligent muting system is used to prevent pops and clicks when disconnecting power supply.\n\n\nAudio Latency and Other Parameters\n\n\nIn digital audio equipment it takes time for the signal at input to be processed and delivered at output. This time is called audio latency. There's three parts to it. The first is the time required for the ADC to do the conversion and to send digital data to the processing unit. The second step is to process data and prepare it for the transfer to the DAC. And the final part is getting the data to the DAC and converting it to the analog signal. The most time consuming is the second part. Parts one and three often require no more than 1 ms depending on architecture of ADC and DAC, sample rate and in-built digital filters.\n\n\n\n\nAn oscillogram showing audio latency of 2.092 ms. pisound and Raspberry Pi 2 working at sample rate of 192 kHz\n\n\n\nFigure 1  Response of the sine signal fed to loop-backed (digital\u2192DAC\u2192ADC\u2192digital) pisound showing the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of 110 dB.

One of those is \nCarla\n - a host for LV2 plugins.\n\n\n\n\nSo let's give it a go.\n\n\nFirst we have to add the repository to apt-get:\n\nwget -q -O - http://rpi.autostatic.com/autostatic.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -\nsudo wget -q -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/autostatic-audio-raspbian.list http://rpi.autostatic.com/autostatic-audio-raspbian.list\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\n\nAfter that's done, let's install \nCarla\n as well as \njackd\n server and \nqjackctl\n for configuring it:\n\nsudo apt-get install carla jackd qjackctl\n\n\n\nThen start \nqjackctl\n, you can do that by hitting Ctrl+F2 and typing in \nqjackctl\n and pressing enter.\n\n\nConfigure it in Setup... like so:\n\n\n\n\nAnd start the jack server by pressing Start:\n\n\n\n\nNow run Carla (Alt+F2, carla, enter)\n\n\nClick Configure Carla and make sure that Audio Driver is set to JACK. It will connect to the already started Jack server. For process mode I've used Single Client, but you can use any option you like.\n\n\nThen you can add plugins in Plugins section, and patch them up in Patch Bay section.\n\n\nThe top screenshot shows \nZSynAddSubFX\n connected to pisound's Input and Output, as well as MIDI data routed to the synth plugin.\n\n\nThere's a couple of plugins readily available to play around within Carla, and you should be able to find more LV2 plugins built for Raspberry Pi to experiment with on the Internet.\n\n\nInternet Radio Station\n\n\nUsing \nicecast\n and \ndarkice\n you can easily setup your own radio station and broadcast whatever is connected to the pisound input!\n\n\nFirst let's get the required software installed:\n\nsudo apt-get install icecast2 darkice\n\n\n\nThen we have to configure the darkice, feel free to customize to your liking.\n\n\nSave the below contents to \n/etc/darkice.cfg\n\n\n# this section describes general aspects of the live streaming session\n[general]\nduration      = 0                # duration of encoding, in seconds. 0 means forever\nbufferSecs    = 2                # size of internal slip buffer, in seconds\nreconnect     = yes              # reconnect to the server(s) if disconnected\n\n# this section describes the audio input that will be streamed\n[input]\ndevice        = hw:1,0           # Alsa soundcard device for the audio input\nsampleRate    = 48000            # sample rate in Hz. try 48000, 96000 or 192000\nbitsPerSample = 16               # bits per sample. try 16\nchannel       = 2                # channels. 1 = mono, 2 = stereo.\n                                 # Only stereo mode is supported by pisound.\n\n# this section describes a streaming connection to an IceCast2 server\n# there may be up to 8 of these sections, named [icecast2-0] ... [icecast2-7]\n# these can be mixed with [icecast-x] and [shoutcast-x] sections\n[icecast2-0]\nbitrateMode   = cbr              # variable bit rate\nbitrate       = 128\nformat        = mp3              # format of the stream: mp3\nquality       = 0.8              # quality of the stream sent to the server\nserver        = localhost        # host name of the server\nport          = 8000             # port of the IceCast2 server, usually 8000\npassword      = hackme           # source password to the IceCast2 server\nmountPoint    = pisound          # mount point of this stream on the IceCast2 server\nname          = pisound          # name of the stream\ndescription   = DarkIce on pisound # description of the stream\nurl           = http://localhost # URL related to the stream\ngenre         = my genre         # genre of the stream\npublic        = no               # advertise this stream?\n#localDumpFile = recording.mp3   # Record also to a file\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally, execute 'darkice' in a terminal or using Alt+F2:\n\n\ndarkice\n\n\nThen from other devices you can connect to \nhttp://raspberrypi_ip:8000/\n to see generic information about the station and \nhttp://raspberry_pi:8000/pisound\n to listen. (Replace raspberrypi_ip in the URLs using the IP of the Raspberry Pi)\n\n\nFor your station to be reachable outside of your local network, you need to have an externally accessible IP address provided by your ISP and you need to configure port forwarding on your router to forward requests on some port to port 8000 on Raspberry Pi.

Though they're still running on an older kernel which was before the pisound driver was integrated, so some manual tweaks are still necessary. Our changes to integrate pisound are still pending on them updating their kernel, you can express your interest here: \nhttps://github.com/volumio/Volumio2/pull/955\n\n\nEventually none of this manual setup is going to be necessary, as soon as Volumio makes a release with an updated kernel.\n\n\n\n\nSteps to get started:\n\n\n\n\nDownload latest Volumio for Raspberry Pi: \nhttps://volumio.org/get-started\n.\n\n\nFlash the image to an SD card, as usual.\n\n\nBoot it.\n\n\nSSH to \nvolumio@volumio.local\n (or use the IP directly after @), password is volumio.\n\n\nIt may take a while after booting until SSH is ready to receive connections.\n\n\nDownload kernel source code using:\n\n\nvolumio kernelsource\n\n\nThe current volumio kernelsource seems to fail before adjusting the kernel version in the sources, but we can fix it up ourselves:\n\n\nsudo nano /usr/src/rpi-linux/include/config/kernel.release\n\n\nMake sure there's a '+' at the end of the version, so it looks like so: \n4.4.9-v7+\n\n\nPress ctrl+x, y and enter to save and exit.\n\n\nDownload the pisound driver code:\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/BlokasLabs/pisound\n\n\nBuild and install it:\n\n\ncd pisound/pisound-module\n\n\nsudo make install\n\n\nAdd pisound to Volumio's DAC selection:\n\n\nsudo nano /volumio/app/plugins/system_controller/i2s_dacs/dacs.json\n\n\nAdd a line somewhere in the middle like so: \n{\"id\":\"pisound\",\"name\":\"pisound\",\"overlay\":\"pisound\",\"alsanum\":\"1\",\"mixer\":\"\",\"modules\":\"\",\"script\":\"\",\"needsreboot\":\"no\"},\n\n\nNote that a comma after this line is necessary, unless it's the last entry in the scope (before }), if there's a syntax error in this file, Volumio won't be able to show playback option in its web interface.\n\n\nSave and exit using ctrl+x, y and enter.\n\n\nOpen \nhttp://volumio.local\n on your PC, go to Settings -> Playback Options.\n\n\nEnable I2S DAC.\n\n\nSelect 'pisound'\n\n\nClick save.

Alternatively, it should be straightforward to adapt the example code to use DIN-5 MIDI ports, as the usbmidi API interface is compatible with Serial API.\n\n\n\n\nGo \nhere\n for full instructions.",

First we have to add the repository to apt-get: wget -q -O - http://rpi.autostatic.com/autostatic.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -\nsudo wget -q -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/autostatic-audio-raspbian.list http://rpi.autostatic.com/autostatic-audio-raspbian.list\nsudo apt-get update \n\nAfter that's done, let's install  Carla  as well as  jackd  server and  qjackctl  for configuring it: sudo apt-get install carla jackd qjackctl \n\nThen start  qjackctl , you can do that by hitting Ctrl+F2 and typing in  qjackctl  and pressing enter.  Configure it in Setup... like so:   And start the jack server by pressing Start:   Now run Carla (Alt+F2, carla, enter)  Click Configure Carla and make sure that Audio Driver is set to JACK. It will connect to the already started Jack server. For process mode I've used Single Client, but you can use any option you like.  Then you can add plugins in Plugins section, and patch them up in Patch Bay section.  The top screenshot shows  ZSynAddSubFX  connected to pisound's Input and Output, as well as MIDI data routed to the synth plugin.  There's a couple of plugins readily available to play around within Carla, and you should be able to find more LV2 plugins built for Raspberry Pi to experiment with on the Internet.",
