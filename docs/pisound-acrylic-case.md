# Pisound Acrylic Case
![pisound-case](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/BlokasLabs/pisound-docs/images/pisound-case.jpg)

A simple but really sturdy and beautiful case for your Pisound and Raspberry Pi. The enclosure is cut from semi-transparent 3 mm thick acrylic sheet with cutouts for the Output ports and the Volume and Gain potentiometers.

The Pisound Acrylic Case consists of 3 cutout sheets of the enclosure sides and a plastic bag containing 4 short spacers, 4 longer ones and a button cap. The case comes with 2 variations of the side with all of the connectors - one for use with Raspberry Pi version 4, the other is for the rest of the models. Make sure to use the correct one for your Raspberry Pi.

## Assembly Instructions

1. Peel off the protective film from all of the acrylic parts.
1. Screw the 25 mm Pisound standoffs (J) to the shortest 5mm standoffs (N) leaving your Pi (L) sandwiched in between.
1. Mount the Pisound board (H) on top of the Pi (L) and fix it with the 8mm standoffs. (E)
1. Mount the jack side of the case (I)[^1] and screw the jack socket nuts (K). The jack socket washers should be on the outer side of the case.
1. Attach the bottom side of the case (O) and fix it with the Pisound 6mm screws. (P)
1. Slide the MIDI ports side (D), USB ports side (M)[^2] and the headers side (G) into the bottom part of the enclosure. Engravings should be facing the internal side.
1. Place the top side of the case (C) on top of the construction leaving the button cap (F) in between.
1. Screw the remaining 4 screws (B) and push the knobs (A) on.


[^1]: Use the correct piece depending on your Raspberry Pi version.

[^2]: It may have to be flipped horizontally depending on your Raspberry Pi version.
