# Pisound & Pure Data

Using Pisound you can run your Pure Data patches straight from a USB thumb drive with a press of a button with no need to connect an external monitor, keyboard or mouse.

If you haven't already, you can install Pure Data via [`pisound-config`](pisound-config.md), in the 'Install Additional Software' menu, or by running the following command in a terminal (commmand) window:

```
sudo apt-get install puredata
```

Plug in a USB drive containing your Pure Data patch, main patch file called **main.pd**, plug in any additional MIDI controller/keyboard, press The Button and *Voil√†!*

You can read more about The Button functionality [here](the-button.md).

Also you may be interested in the [Pisound App](pisound-app.md).

## Configuring Pure Data

By default, Pure Data is launched when <a href="https://github.com/BlokasLabs/pisound/blob/master/scripts/common/start_puredata.sh#L60" target="_blank">single-clicking</a> the button as so:

```
puredata -stderr -alsa -audioadddev pisound -alsamidi -channels 2 -r 48000 -mididev 1 -send ";pd dsp 1" $@ &
```

You may want to customize the command line arguments for Pure Data according to your own needs. To do that, check the <a href="https://puredata.info/docs/faq/commandline" target="_blank">Pure Data's Command Line</a> documentation and edit `/usr/local/pisound/scripts/common/start_puredata.sh`.
